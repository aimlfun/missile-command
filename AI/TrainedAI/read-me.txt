I've pre-trained the CPU ABMs. They are about 60% accurate, which far exceeds most mere mortals.

Using genetic evolution isn't a super reliable / efficient way, so if you FAIL to deploy these files, it will
attempt to learn based on a pattern of targets I used that eventually led to a pretty good missile system.

Perceptrons without back-propagation can be hit-or-miss at finding the optimum.

Playing the game to learn was too slow (given speed of missiles, pause to count etc). So I came up with specific
alternating sides and altitudes to coax it into not becoming to "specialised" for left or right or top.
Feel free to improve it.
