To use the trained neural network (i.e. play the game right away), copy AI\TrainedAI\*.* to %appdata%\MissileDefenceAI\AIModels

Please note:
1) This "game" was built to prove the concept of a neural network targetting system, on an Intel I7 + NVIDIA 2060 RTX, on which it runs suitably quick. I would expect developers to have a similar performing or better device.
2) It was built using Visual Studio 2022 Community, and for .net 6.
