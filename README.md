This application requires .net6 and Visual Studio 2022 (Community works).

1. Download https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/
2. Download the source-code as a ZIP. 
3. Save it where you like - I tend to use c:\repos\ai\{folder-name}, feel free to choose a better folder.
4. Open the solution, and enjoy!

Any problems? Post a comment on my blog, and I will happily try to assist.

To use the trained neural network (i.e. play the game right away), copy AI\TrainedAI\*.* to %appdata%\MissileDefenceAI\AIModels

Please note: This "game" was built to prove the concept of a neural network targeting system, on an Intel I7 + NVIDIA 2060 RTX, on which it runs suitably quick. I would expect developers to have a similar performing or better device.
